Performing data analytics on a famous sports game called cricket t20 format

In this Project I have analyzed the data on the famous sport called Cricket. I have done this project using web scrapping, python, pandas and power BI.
First I have collected the data from the official cricket website named ESPN. Specifically, I have collected the T20 cricket format data from this website.

1. Data Collection using web application called Bright Data and Javascript : To collect the Data there are various options either you can collect the data manually into the excel sheet or using the Python and it's libraries you can fetch the data. In this particular project I have fetched the data via a web application called "Bright Data". Bright data allows to fetch the data using simple JavaScript code and HTML elements and stored it in the json format. I have fetched 4 types of data and stored it in 4 different types of json files, 1st is match summary, 2nd batting summary, 3rd bowling summary and 4th player info.

2. Data cleaning and transformation using Python Pandas : Now we have collected the data we will clean the data and transmorn it into required csv files.
